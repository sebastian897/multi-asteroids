(There is no longer any need to download raylib separately. cmake fetches it for us)

 cd multi-asteroids

 # the 1st if the 2 cmake commands below "configures" the build (this includes downloading raylib)
 # then second will build 4 things
 # the raylib library
 # a multi-asteroid-common library
 # a client executable
 # a server executable
 # it will only build what has changed, so it will be fast after the first build
 # it also produces a file compile_commands.json which helps clangd understand your code
 cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo && cmake --build build

# all the compiled stuff (object files, library files, executables) are in the build dir
build/server.exe
build/client.exe

#in vscode
# install the clangd extension, this will do the stuff you need..
# do not install any microsoft c/c++ extensions

# later on we can also work on using clang-format  which automatically formats your 
# code (all the indentation) according to rules which you can control yourself
