open msys2 gold console  (UCRT64)

git clone git@github.com:sebastian897/multi-asteroids.git

(There is no longer any need to download raylib separately. cmake fetches it for us)

 cd multi-asteroids
 # this will build 4 things
 # the raylib library
 # a multi-asteroid-common library
 # a client executable
 # a server executable
 cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo && cmake --build build


#in vscode
# install the clangd extension


# later on we can also work on using clang-format  which automatically formats your 
# code (all the indentation) according to rules which you can control yourself
